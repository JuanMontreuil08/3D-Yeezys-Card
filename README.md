# 3D-Yeezys-Card
Let me show you my first programming project! I took a png photo of a yeezy and started coding using Javascript, CSS and HTML. 
Here I learn that the HTML File builds the Title, H1, H2. Also, i linked the picture in this File. Then the Style.css file focuses on the colors, dimensions of the Card, Sneaker, Titles. Finally, the app-js file focuses on creating the 3D animation in the card. Also creates the transition to optimize the 3D effect. 

I am an absolute beginner in the world of coding, but I extremenly like it.
I will not finish this read me file without saying THANKS TO DEVELOPEDBYED YOUTUBE CHANNEL!. He is a great developer and an outstanding code professor.
